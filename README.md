This world is inhabited by both humans and dragon races, where the dragons, as ancient beings, possess formidable power and profound wisdom. Humans live under the protection of the dragons and share in their challenging and adventurous stories.

Game Setting: Within the human population of this world, there are individuals with dragon bloodlines, and different bloodline purity levels grant varying physical abilities and powers. These bloodlines are classified into S-level, A-level, B-level, C-level, and D-level based on their purity. Bloodline purity cannot be changed, but abilities can grow and develop over time.

The protagonist, Luming Fei, has an unidentified background and possesses an S-level bloodline. However, his bloodline doesn't grant him any special abilities; instead, it brings forth a demon within his heart named Luming Ze. Luming Fei can fulfill any wish by exchanging one-quarter of his life, but he refuses to die and instead strives to eliminate all his enemies through his own efforts.
